# Weekly Training Problems 


This space archives the problems for the MUA programming marathons training sessions.

The repository is organized as follows:
  - The firts folder level indicates the training weeks
  - Inside each week there is a folder corresponding to each individual problem 
  - Each problem contains exactly 4 folders, each providing a solution for each of the allowed programming languages (i.e., C, C++, Java, and Python)
  - Each solution should contain the single solution file, a readme file containing the name of the person that solved it, the solution time, and its complexity.
